* Built using RStudio's [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package and the [Hugo Academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic).
* Deployed to Netlify. Yihui Xie's [blog post](https://yihui.name/en/2017/06/netlify-instead-of-github-pages/) convinved me to switch from GitHub pages to Netlify.
* I use a different domain name than the one provided by Netlify. I opted for a free [`rbind.io`](https://support.rbind.io/) subdomain offered by RStudio. Note this involved filing a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/69).

The above is based on Alison Presmanes Hill's  [tutorial](https://apreshill.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/); take a look to get up and running quick.
