title = "The Myth of the Importance of Knowing All Your Goals Now!"
abstract = "'What do I want to do with my life?' is a question young people often struggle with. When I was younger, one commonly proposed solution was to 'follow your passion.' However this approach assumes you know exactly what you are passionate about, putting undue pressure on you to identify all your goals early on. I'll present an alternative 'learn about yourself' approach that in my opinion is both more feasible and actually more commonly followed in practice. This approach assumes you don't know all your goals early on and proposes incremental steps towards figuring them out."
